# TeamPerms
 A simple permissions mod using scoreboard teams as groups.

## How-To
To assign commands to teams, you need to specify in the configuration generated by the mod which commands belong to which teams.
The default configuration can be found in `<server root>/config/TeamPerms.json`, and [looks something like this](src/main/resources/default-config.json).

The `teamCommands` property in the configuration is what contains the teams and their associated commands.
#### Things to Note
- The order is important. Teams that are higher up on the list inherit all of the commands within the teams below them. 
- The order of the commands within each team is unimportant.
- Team name matching is case-insensitive, meaning you can have a all-lowercase team in-game and an all-uppercase team in the config, and they will still match.
